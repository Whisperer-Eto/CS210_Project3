3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Autocomplete Term)
       Approach: compareTo, compare two string, not number

       Issues and resolution: I change Double.compare to String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER.compare, in this way I can
       compare two string as the long of the string, so I can get the difference between the string. And if I need it
       I can use this method to get how long the string is.

       Approach: ReverseWeightOrder, the output is not right

       Issues and resolution: I get output is opposite way all the time, if I want 1, I get -1. So I swap two number,
       the first number put in the last place, then I can get the right output.

       Approach: PrefixOrder, I am working on how to make this class inside a class work.

       Issues and resolution: I take tutoring class, and Laura explained to me what is this code mean, she say I am
       calling a object and make the a class create object, but it just make order in other way.

       Approach:PrefixOrder.compare, there is a corner case, when "r" biger then the "Term", it will trow a error. But
       if I use min(), my project did not input math.java. My tutor Laure say I can use Math.min to input it, and I can
       substring them to get the output I want.

   Problem 2 (Binary Search Deluxe)
       Approach: LastIndexOf

       Issues and resolution: need to make my own Binary Search. First, I go over the binary search code from our class
       and drow the working principle on paper, then I change it to the Binary Search Deluxe we need. But the thing is,
       I can not just change the variable. So I google it, and learned from other people's understanding of Binary
       Search, and I remembered my goal. I am not make a new Binary Search, I just need change it. So I get the code
       form class, then I change it to receiver, It is work. there is some error on the first time, but the hint on
       gradescope help me debug.

   Problem 3 (Autocomplete)
       Approach: Porblem 94, make BinarySearchDeluxe handles empty arrays correctly

       Issues and resolution:  If give Auto complete with arguments ([]), I need output value 0, but I use b-a+1, so if
       b-a =0, then my out put is 1, witch is incorrect. So I naively use if b-a = 0,then return 0, but it not work. So
       I think about the reason why this happen, I see the Term1 is [], so I use terms.length == 0, this time it work.

       Approach: Porblem 93, give [] to autocomplete

       Issues and recolution: if we give [], then I need output something to make sure my code can handles empty arryar
       but output a empty arrayr. So I try to return 0, but it say I have to return trem, not int. So I try to return
       new a object term[0], that make me have a empty arrays.

       Approach: Porblem 91 & 95

       Issues and resolution: I did not solve it, I need help on that, but it is too late
   
4. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   Laura               tutor          help me on java language, and explain to me what the code means.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I feel very confidence this time. Thanks to my tutoring class, I did very good job on three exercise. This three
   problem help me go through the basic java code we lean on class. By doing this, I did much biter then projet 1 & 2
   This time, I star from the first day, but I still need more help, because porblem 91 & 95 I did not make it. there
   is not hint on gradescope, also I did not google it out. I will ask about this next week.
